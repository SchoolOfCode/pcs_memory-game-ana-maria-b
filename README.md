# Build a memory game
You will be building a memory game using an API that will give you back 52 cards.

Check for cards if they match give a point, until all cards have been found.

It will be a chance to embed the topics we covered in the session and continue practice breaking down problems into solvable chunks.

Take time to plan before you start coding.

### Requirements
- Should use Object/Array
- DOM manipulation
- Fetching data using fetch API
- Using CSS FlexBox or CSS-grid/ CSS in general
- Array methods
- Conditional logic statements

### Features

- Fetch the data from the API 
--[API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/) - Click the API link to be taken to the API documentation page.
- Match the cards based on value, 2 at a time (2 diamonds / 2 spades) etc order does not matter but value does 2 == 2 etc.
- Keep track of score (every time a card is matched)

### Extra Features

- Make it a two player game
- Keep track of player 1 score as well as player 2 score
- Keep track of the cards each respective player has selected and matched in a array that is then displayed on their side (player 1 on the left side and player 2 on the right side, may adjust format/layout as you please)
- Have a win/lose/draw condition and rendering accordingly to screen.
